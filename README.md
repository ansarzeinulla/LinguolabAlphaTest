**LinguoLab** is an innovative language-educational mobile app. The key is to immerse the user instead of teaching rules. Unlike Duolingo, immersion happens through films, news, blogs, videos, and real-life scenarios.

This repository contains a **bad** prototype version of the app, developed in Android Studio.

Currently, as of **March 20, 2025**, the project is frozen.
